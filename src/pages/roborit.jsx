                The IEEE RoBoRIT is a professional society under the umbrella of
                the Ramaiah Institue Of Technology. It focuses on promoting the
                theory and practice of robotics and its application across
                various fields of engineering and science.
                <br></br>
                IEEE RoBoRIT chapters organize events, conferences, workshops,
                and technical activities to foster knowledge exchange,
                collaboration, and advancement in the field. We provide a
                platform for researchers, engineers, and students to share their
                work, discuss emerging trends, and explore new ideas in robotics
                and its application.

                  <br></br>
                  HARD-WAR HACKATHON is the first hardware hackathon being
                  conducted in MSRIT by ROBO-RIT. This Hackathon is not only
                  about coding but giving more importance to the hardware as
                  well. Teams were given a duration of 7 hrs to build a project
                  using any Hardware components. At the end of the time
                  duration, they would be judged based on various factors of the
                  project.
