                  This event is divided into two phases - a design contest, and a workshop.
Participants are required to build a piece of design from scratch which will then be turned into an
NFT. The design phase will be followed by a workshop where participants will be taken through
the process of turning any piece of art into an NFT - starting with setting up their Cryptocurrency
wallets and making an account. Participants will learn how to mint their first NFT and upload it
on the market for sale.
The best designs will be rewarded.
