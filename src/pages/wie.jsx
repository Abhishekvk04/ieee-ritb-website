                                    IEEE RIT-B Women in Engineering (IEEE RIT-B WIE) is a local chapter of IEEE RIT-B that was established in 2016. Our primary objective is to empower and engage women in the technical field by organizing a variety of webinars, workshops, events, and panel discussions. Through these activities, we strive to enhance their knowledge, showcase their technical skills, and foster their professional growth.
                                    At IEEE RIT-B WIE, we are committed to raising awareness about the unique challenges faced by women in the world of technology, as well as in other areas such as health. By addressing these challenges and providing a platform for open discussions, we aim to create a supportive and inclusive environment that encourages women to overcome barriers and succeed in their chosen fields.
